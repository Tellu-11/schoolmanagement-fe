# ðŸ“š School Management â€“ Frontend

This is the frontend for [School Management](https://github.com/Tellu-11/schoolmanagement).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

- [Makefile](#make-installation)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Start the application

### Make Installation

Since we will be using Makefile to run the application, you need to install it first:

- On Windows, you can install it using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install).
  After installing Chocolatey, you can run `choco install make` to install Makefile.
- On Linux, you can install it using `sudo apt-get install make`.

And then run:

```
make run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
